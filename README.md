# Surfs Up

## Overview of the Analysis:
An analysis was requested to determine temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu.  The purpose was in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results of the Analysis:
* Data collected for the month of June:
  * Total of 1,700 data points
  * Mean temp of 74.9 degrees

## Summary of the Analysis:
Based on the average temp (71.0 degrees) and min temp (56 degrees) for the month of December, a surf and ice cream shop could still be sustainable year-round.  Two additional queries may be beneficial as well.  The amount of precipitation may be helpful to see if store hours could be modified in the winter months.  Also, doing an analysis by station would be beneficial to determine ideal locations.
